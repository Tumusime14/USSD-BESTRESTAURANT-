# USSD-BEST RESTAURANT
This project is both designed in web and USSD to allow all restaurant-registered users to press an order
In simple ways.
BEST RESTAURANT
This repository contains a USSD application that allows restaurant users to make an order of their desired dish.
Users can register, view the menu, place orders, and view his/her order status.
From now I haven't had a chance to develop it so they can use SMS to register but we're working on it.

   
Database Configuration:
   - Create a MySQL database and name it "**restora**".
   - Import the restora.sql file provided in the repository to set up the required tables.
Run the USSD App in Postman with any number if not registered you'll be altered to register to proceed.
After registration, you're able to view the restaurant menu and place an order.
